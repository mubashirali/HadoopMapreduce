# HadoopMapreduce

Data Indexing &amp; Query Processing using Apache Hadoop Mapreduce

A cloud computing course project which aims to index a large data using MapReduce. It creates a dictionary of unique words preset in the dataset and stores each line/sentence in a new text file where line/sentence number represents the file name and in parallel it creates an inverted index (postings file) which is an indexed data structure storing a mapping from content, such as words or numbers, to its locations in a document or a set of documents. The purpose of an inverted index is to allow fast full text searches.
